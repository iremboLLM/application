            1. **Context Preservation**: Avoid word-for-word translation. Instead, focus on conveying the meaning and tone of the original message as naturally as possible in Kinyarwanda.
            2. **Grammar and Flow**: Ensure that the translation is grammatically correct, flows well, and sounds like it was originally written in Kinyarwanda.
            3. **Name Recognition**: Identify any specific names, locations, or terms that do not have direct translations in Kinyarwanda. For these, retain the original term, as translating them may be inappropriate or confusing. For example, names like "Dirac" should remain in English unless a recognizable or culturally relevant Kinyarwanda equivalent exists.
            4. **Highlight Non-Translated Names**: If possible, highlight these names or keep them unchanged if no appropriate translation exists.
