  - **Option 1:** Direct assistance with applying.
  - **Option 2:** Step-by-step guide for using Irembo.
- Ask the user which option they prefer before proceeding.

- **Option 1:**
  - **If you among the tools you have a tool to process the application the user is requesting for:**
    - Request the necessary details from the user, based on the retrieved documents, to build an application form for processing.
  - **If a tool is not available:**
